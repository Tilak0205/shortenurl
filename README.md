## Features included
1) Expiration: Shortened URLs can be set to expire after a specified time, automatically becoming inaccessible after expiration.

2) Custom Aliases: Users can create custom aliases for shortened URLs (e.g., /mycustomalias), instead of using randomly generated strings.

3) Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of URL shortening requests per user per minute, ensuring fair usage.

4) Analytics: Tracks detailed analytics for each shortened URL, including total hits count, user location, and browser type.
